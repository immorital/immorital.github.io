The Crag is where climbers test themselves against stone, gravity, and their own limits. It’s where struggle and perseverance meet purpose. This space is the same. The Crag is about climbing, but it’s also about something deeper: faith, solidarity, and the fight for a better world. I climb because it teaches me discipline, humility, and trust. I write because the world we live in demands more than silence. At the crag, you don’t climb alone you rely on others, you spot, you belay, you share the load. That’s what community is. That’s what socialism is. This site is my rope and chalk bag: a place to grip ideas, stories, and struggles, and to keep reaching upward. I started thecrag.jp as a way to share thoughts from the rock, capture moments beyond the wall, and explore what it means to climb, not just rocks but the world.<br/>

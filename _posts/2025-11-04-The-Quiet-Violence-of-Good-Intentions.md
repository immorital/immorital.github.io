I wanted to drop something introspective about organizing, not from theory or abstraction, but from experience. As an African American man, my path in activism has never followed the usual route. When I was younger, my politics were direct and digital. I fought systems from behind a keyboard, targeting the infrastructure that upheld injustice.

That kind of work was clean in a way. No committees, no fragile egos, no hidden hierarchies. Just impact. Who could fuck them up the hardest. It was a contest to see who had the bigger bomb.

Organizing, though, is different. It’s messy, emotional, and full of contradictions. It’s also where I learned that some of the most harmful forms of racism don’t come from those who wear red hats or shout slurs. They come from the ones who say “I’m with you.” Over a short but heavy period serving as a liaison for a leftist organization, I experienced three things that completely reshaped how I see “allyship” and “solidarity,” and have helped me finally understand why Black radicals are often segregated from their white counterparts. These aren’t distant reflections; they’re hard lessons learned in real time about performance, control, and the quiet violence of good intentions.

It’s important to say that this organization I was the liaison for, like many others that grow out of niche “American” interests, had a heavy white majority. That alone isn’t an issue, but it sets the stage for how race and power quietly shape everything from who gets heard, who gets dismissed, all the way to who gets disciplined for breaking unspoken social rules.

The first thing I noticed was how performative allyship operates as a kind of social currency. Many white members are more interested in appearing anti-racist than actually building trust or accountability with Black members, inside and outside the organization. It should be stated plainly that this dynamic rewards optics over honesty, and it gives white liberals and leftists a safety net.

Performative allyship is safe because it costs nothing. You get to look like you care without ever having to risk your comfort or your influence. But what’s often ignored is that this safety has come at the expense of the very people they claim to stand with and for. It’s not just hypocrisy, and it’s not just white saviorism. It’s a deliberate refusal to let go of control.

This isn’t abstract. It played out constantly in the organization I was once a part of, and if an organization is to work with and support Black communities, it must be acknowledged and prevented.

The second issue was fragility. White fragility. And this isn’t something only seen in Caucasians; I see this in my mixed brethren and members too. White fragility often disguises itself as accountability. It often looks polished, filled with committee language, “check-ins,” and talk of respect, but underneath, it’s just another way to silence critique. Every time race came up, the conversation shifted away from the issue and toward protecting someone’s feelings. The moment I said something uncomfortable, it wasn’t “How do we fix or address this?” It was “Why did you say it that way?”

The most striking example of this came when I was confronted for calling a significant portion of our region “crackers” for not acknowledging the effects that a ruling would have on minorities in its current iteration at that time, which they said was an assumption of whiteness despite us barely speaking before. That moment signified something to me: that it wasn’t about the word.

It was about control. About drawing the conversation back to comfort zones.
<br/><br/>
What it revealed to me was how identity can become a shield in white-led or white-majority spaces. “Mixed” or “BIPOC” identity gets used like a hall pass to avoid real accountability when marginalized communities or their members can or will be affected by something.

This same behavior showed itself again recently when a public figure associated with our broader circles was found to have a Nazi tattoo and a history of promoting violent far-right rhetoric. I raised concerns about how someone like that could have even gotten close to movements claiming to stand for liberation, and I made it clear that a stronger stance on this issue was necessary, especially for Black members who would understandably feel unsafe or alienated. Instead of solidarity, I was met with deflection. Some accused me of “rage-quitting” when I told them that I would leave the organization because of this. Others, including a few Black members, told me they didn’t care or even supported the candidate despite their past and the marks of hatred toward people like me on their body.

That moment made everything crystal clear. “As a BIPOC person…” had become a way to silence any critique of racial dynamics rather than confront it. My skin color was effectively a token to be awarded to the white members and not respected.

That’s what tokenization looks like in real time.  
You’re not seen as a peer, but you are a display item in the window of the mall. You are an insurance policy against accusations of racism to them.

This is dehumanizing and the left’s most disgusting form of racism. When I spoke up, I wasn’t treated as someone with insight, I was treated as a problem to be managed.

The third thing I saw was how quickly a culture built on “collectivism” can turn into one of containment. Whenever I brought something forward , a new system, a suggestion, or even an idea for education ,  it was never met with curiosity but with skepticism. Every project I initiated was met with an immediate critique, usually from the same people who hadn’t done the work themselves. I spent weeks drafting a guide meant to help members protect themselves in a time where surveillance and political repression are real. Instead of support, I got a public lecture about how my tone was “too paranoid.”

I wasn’t asking for a review.

I was sharing my expertise as a cybersecurity analyst who’s been in this field for a decade, with numerous accomplishments, like being the first Black man in my family to be personally invited out to and offered internship at Google and Apple in highschool. But instead of collaboration, I got condescension. I got treated as if the decade of my teenage years which I devoted almost entirely to pursuing cybersecurity were not even close to my lighter-skinned counterparts who had it easier.

Then came the ruling I mentioned earlier, a program supposedly meant to track in-person engagement. On paper, it sounded fine. In practice, it was another form of gatekeeping, built with no understanding of how systemic racism shapes access to self-defense and medical training.  
When I brought up how this system would isolate BIPOC members, I was met with resistance.
<br/><br/>
Not questions.
<br/><br/>
Resistance.
<br/><br/>
And that’s the heart of it: every time a Black person challenges a white-led structure, the response is never dialogue, it’s discipline. The “discussion” (if it can even be called one), becomes more about procedure, tone, or process rather than the truth.

By the end, I realized I was more exhausted than angry. I had spent a month trying to make a space better for people who look like me and those who don’t. All I achieved in that time was being gaslit, second-guessing myself at every turn, and feeling invalidated.

Looking back, the irony is painful. I joined the organization because I believed it was different. I believed the talk of “mutual aid” and “community defense” actually meant something and that the people in the organization held it as important as I do. But after a while, I started to understand what most Black organizers learn too late:

Solidarity that only exists when you agree is just another form of control.
<br/><br/>
This is why we in the Black community have our own separate radical spaces. And it’s disheartening and depressing that we have to segregate ourselves.

While some will say that the root of this issue is miscommunication, I will push back and implore you to use your brain more often. This is about who gets to define “professionalism,” who gets to decide what’s “too much,” and who gets to be heard without being punished for it.

I’m tired of white-majority spaces, both liberal and left, talking about diversity while doing nothing to build an environment that sustains it. I’m tired of being the token success story in rooms where no one listens. And I’m tired of the expectation that we should be grateful for inclusion that’s conditional.

If you say you want to build with us, then understand what that truly means and encapsulates. It means learning the history that shaped our fear, our anger, our caution, and how that affects us now.

It means understanding why access to self-defense, education, and medicine looks different for us, and listening to how that can be improved.

And it means doing more than repeating the right words online, more than quoting the Black Panthers. (The amount of white people who dick ride the Panthers but still exhibit white supremacy, even in small forms, is fucking mental.) It means showing up when it’s uncomfortable.

I should be clear that in writing this, I do not seek a segregation of Black radical spaces from majority-white ones or vice versa, but rather to expose the root that has caused this division in leftist spaces. To expose what’s rotting under the bridges we try to form. The leftist organizations that do exist have a lot of potential, but they need to confront this dark and unsettling truth:

Liberation is not built on white comfort.
<br/><br/>
Maybe these organizations need a Black caucus. Maybe they need to stop pretending to be something they aren’t until they earn that right. Either way, real change starts when people stop mistaking optics for action and stop using “allyship” as armor.

If this reflection does anything, I hope it forces a few people to sit with their own fragility, to stop fighting and defending it.

I hope it causes them to dismantle it. Because I’m done begging for space in movements that claim to fight for freedom but flinch when they see it in action.

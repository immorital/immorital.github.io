title: "Some of Those That Work Forces..."

One day this week I was listening to Rage Against the Machine — specifically their track _Killing in the Name_ — when a particular verse stopped me in my tracks:

> “Some of those that work forces, are the same that burn crosses.”

Growing up, we’re taught that police exist to “serve and protect.” We’re told they’re guardians of peace, defenders of the weak, and keepers of order in a chaotic world. But as I’ve grown older — read more, listened more, experienced more — I’ve come to realize that this narrative is, at best, misleading and, at worst, a carefully curated lie.

This piece isn’t about hate. It’s about truth — truth that’s been hidden, ignored, and whitewashed for generations. My goal here is not to sensationalize. It’s to _de-obfuscate_ — to pull the veil back. Because once you know the roots, you begin to understand the rot.

## The Slave and the Horseman

Most Americans are never taught the true origins of policing. It didn’t begin with neighborhood patrols or community safety. It began with fear, hatred, and racial control.

In the American South, the earliest form of organized policing was the _Slave Patrol_, also known as “paddy rollers.” Sanctioned by local governments in the 18th and 19th centuries, their mission was explicit: hunt down escaped enslaved people, prevent uprisings, and enforce slave codes.

Let that sink in.

The foundation of modern U.S. policing is built on the violent enforcement of white supremacy. These patrols weren’t vigilantes — they were official arms of the state. They disrupted Black gatherings, harassed free Black people, suppressed literacy and education, and kept entire communities in a state of terror.

After slavery was “abolished” in 1865, the patrols didn’t disappear. They rebranded. States enacted _Black Codes_ — laws designed to criminalize Black life under the guise of maintaining order. Loitering, unemployment, even the _wrong tone_ could mean jail or forced labor.

The mission stayed the same:  
**Control and suppress Black freedom.**

During the Jim Crow era, police departments became institutionalized enforcers of segregation. They cracked down on civil rights protests with dogs, hoses, tear gas, and clubs. Meanwhile, they turned a blind eye — or gave active support — to white supremacist violence.

## When the Badge and the Hood Overlap

The connection between police and white supremacist groups isn’t just a relic of the past — it’s part of our living history.

In 2006, the FBI released a report warning that white supremacists had been actively infiltrating law enforcement across the country. These weren’t vague suspicions — they were documented concerns. And yet, little was done to address them. No serious oversight followed. No systemic purging occurred.

In fact, in many departments, the infiltration wasn’t a bug — it was a feature. From shared ideology to quiet complicity, the line between the badge and the hood blurred long ago.

Photos exist of officers flashing white power hand signs. Of fraternizing at Klan events. Of openly spreading hateful rhetoric on social media under their own names — often without consequence.

And if they’re willing to be that open, what are they doing behind closed doors?

This isn’t paranoia. It’s precedent.

## What Does Resistance Cost?

If you want proof that this isn't “ancient history,” look to Philadelphia on May 13, 1985.

The city dropped a bomb on its own citizens.

The MOVE Organization — a Black liberation and communalist group — had long been targeted by law enforcement for their beliefs and refusal to conform. After years of tension, surveillance, and harassment, the city ordered a military-style raid on their West Philly home.

Police fired over 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Then, from a helicopter, they dropped an explosive device on the roof.

The result?

- Eleven people dead, including five children.
    
- Sixty-five homes destroyed.
    
- A neighborhood reduced to ash.

This wasn’t a “mistake.” It was planned, sanctioned, and executed with full knowledge of the likely consequences. It remains one of the clearest modern examples of a city treating its own citizens as enemy combatants.

MOVE wasn’t a threat to public safety. They were a threat to the illusion of control.

## Is Reform Enough?

People still say, “We need reform.”

I used to believe that too. Until the patterns became undeniable. Until it was clear that more training, more oversight, and more body cams only served to give the illusion of accountability.

You can’t reform something that’s doing exactly what it was designed to do.

Just recently, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia — a husband, father, and legal immigrant — was deported to El Salvador. He was detained and thrown into CECOT, the world’s largest mega-prison, known for its authoritarian brutality.

His crime?  
Being Hispanic.

His story?  
One of many.

When systems are built on white supremacy, violence, and unchecked power — they don’t malfunction. They perform exactly as intended.

## So What Can We Do?

We have to ask deeper questions:  
What does safety actually look like?  
Who is it for?  
And who does policing really serve?

If an institution is rooted in oppression, upheld through violence, and protected by impunity, then maybe the answer isn’t to fix it.

Maybe the answer is to _replace_ it.

We can reimagine community safety. We can build models centered on care, support, and prevention — not punishment. We can redirect resources toward education, housing, health care, and mental health — the true foundations of peace.

But it starts with honesty.  
Honesty about our past.  
Honesty about the present.  
And honesty about what kind of future we’re willing to fight for.

Because until we understand the origins,  
We’ll keep repeating the same horror —  
Just with better PR.

*Writing for this began a few days after the Inauguration. What started as a call to arms instead has shifted. This writing was the first political one I wrote and I believe that if ANY new group like that of the BPP is to start this article should act as a foundation, cornerstone, to the Vanguard*
# Introduction
As we have witnessed in recent years and even in the past few days, there has been a troubling rise in Nazi rhetoric, as well as attacks and threats against marginalized communities. In 2023 alone the ADL reported a 337% surge in antisemitic incidents following the October 7th attacks, alongside a 45% rise in anti-trans violence. Today, I stand before you not as a representative of any organization, but as an individual driven by the weight of injustice and the hope for a brighter, more equitable future. This vision - a call to those who feel the oppressive hand of a system designed to divide, exploit, and discard us. 

The struggles we all face are not mere isolated events, but rather they are interconnected. The fight for justice cannot belong to any one race, identity, or community. It must be a fight for all people oppressed by the systems that profit from our suffering. Inspired by the legacy of those who came before, I seek to build something new: A movement rooted in solidarity, humility, and empathy for the common man. Where pragmatism is a virtue, not a fleeting convenience or an afterthought. Where we are guided by justice and driven by the collective will to create a nation where everyone can thrive.

# Core Values & Principles

Our struggles must be rooted in the belief that justice **must** be universal, and that individuals must be given the ability to be free from the collective and that the right to self determination belongs to everyone no matter who they are. To not only seek this out but to build a nation that allows us all to thrive we must not seek to simply reform the systems that threaten us or oppress us, but we must seek to dismantle them and replace them with a system built on a foundation of equity, dignity, and liberation. These principles should define the movement and guide our actions. 

## Self-Determination and Universal Justice

It should be our belief that all people -- regardless of race, gender, sexuality, ability, nationality, or economic standing, deserves the right to shape their own destinies. True self-determination means that no government, corporation or institution should have any say or unchecked power over the lives of citizens that would allow an individual or community to be forced into subjugation by systems designed by those in power to exploit them by ending qualified immunity for police and repealing the 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act that silences incarcerated voices.

For too long, the ruling class, the wealthy class, and the bureaucratic class, has thrived by pitting oppressed peoples against one another. By turning class issues into culture issues they single handedly dismantled the solidarity we once had as brothers and sisters of America. They tell us that justice is a limited resource only to be extended to its full capabilities when one of them is threatened, that progress for one group means the suffering of another.

This is a lie.

Our liberation and ability to achieve justice and peace and economic stability is interconnected, when one community rises, we all rise. We  need to begin to reject this false choice that has been imposed on us and not settle for justice that applies to some but not all of us. We should not be complacent with the idea that equality is conditional or that one form of oppression has to be traded for another form. We need to begin to demand a world where equity is not privilege, but a right. Self-determination is like a community garden—we decide what to plant, nurture, and harvest.

## Coalition Building: Unity Across Struggle

In todays modern world no single group can dismantle systemic oppression alone. The forces that exploit us--plutocracy, imperialism, white supremacy-- Do not operate in complete darkness and isolation, and neither can we. The only way for us to win is through solidarity.

Through this manifesto, I call for an alliance of all who have been cast aside, all who have been denied their humanity, all who refuse to remain silent. Our struggles include but are not limited to :

- **Black, Indigenous, and other people of color**, who have been historically and systematically oppressed, criminalized, and exploited.
    
- **Workers and the poor**, who have been robbed of their labor, their dignity, and their future by the unchecked greed of the wealthy. It's unfair and unjust that 58% of U.S. workers earn less than $40k/year while CEOs make 399x their employees (Economic Policy Institute).
    
- **Immigrants and refugees**, who are scapegoated, detained, and dehumanized by borders that exist only to serve the powerful. For those we should call for an End to mass deportations and expand DACA to cover all 14 million undocumented neighbors.
    
- **Women and LGBTQ+ individuals**, who face systemic violence, economic injustice, and political exclusion.
    
- **The disabled and chronically ill**, who are denied access to proper medical care, autonomy, and respect in a world designed to exclude them.

We need to recognize that our struggles are not separate. The fight against racial injustice is also a fight against economic inequality. The fight for gender liberation is also a fight for healthcare and bodily autonomy. The fight against corporate imperialism is a fight for environmental justice. 

We should reject the notion that one group's liberation must come at the expense of another's and instead, should embrace the politics of a shared struggle. That is to say, one that understands that the system does not fear any one movement alone but instead fears all of us standing together.

## Self-Defense and Tactical Resistance

We believe in the right of all people to defend themselves against violence and exploitation, in all its forms, with equal force. A great example is in 2020, when the NFAC, a Black militia, mobilized in Louisville to protect protesters demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, ensuring their safety amid threats of violence. The idea that a resistance must be passive while operating within a system that actively seeks to oppress said movement is ridiculous and should be ridiculed as nothing more than the delusions of a mad man, Telling oppressed people to be peaceful is like asking a burning house to put itself out. Would you say that a man who shoots a deer with the intent of using its meat for sustenance is a violent behemoth? Would you say someone who carries a firearm is a crazed extreme terrorist? To defend and arm ourselves is not an act of aggression but merely an act of survival. 

But self-defense is not just about arms. It is very much knowledge, organization, and resilience focused. It's about defending our communities from the forces that seek to keep us in fear whether that is violence of the police, the violence of poverty, or the violence of a government that values profit over people.

Tactical Resistance means :

- **Community Self-Defense**: Ensuring that all people, especially those most at risk, are equipped to protect themselves from violence—whether physical, legal, or economic.
    
- **Mutual Aid and Resource Sharing**: Building networks of support that provide food, shelter, education, and medical care outside the control of the state.
    
- **Political Resistance**: Organizing against oppressive laws and policies, resisting voter suppression, and dismantling the institutions that uphold systemic injustice.
    
- **Economic Resistance**: Challenging corporate exploitation through labor organizing, strikes, and collective economic action.

We should not advocate for violence, but we should reject the notion that violence doesn't start revolutions and the expectation that we will accept violence against us without response. We believe in the right to protect ourselves, our families and our communities from all forms of arm. 

We aren't here to ask for our freedom or country back. We have done that for far to long. Now is the time to claim it.

# Goals and Demands

Our movement should not be one of empty rhetoric and wishful thinking despite me writing this in those exact conditions. We need to demand changes that dismantle oppression and build a world that is just equitable and free. To do this our goals need not to be aspirational as they are necessary steps towards liberation.

## Economic Justice and Labor Rights

1. **Living Wages and Worker Protections**: Every worker deserves fair compensation and dignity in the workplace for the work that they do for the economy and society as a whole. We need to demand a living wage and stronger labor protections for both individual employees and unions, and an end to exploitative practices such as wage theft and union busting.  We need to demand that there be a tax  on extreme wealth at 90% over $1B (as proposed by Bernie Sanders’ OLIGARCH Act) to fund free college and reparations.
    
2. **Wealth Redistribution**: The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few is an injustice and downright disgusting act, that when combined with the recent news that those who make up the 1% were in attendance at the inauguration of Trump, should point to a critical flaw within the current systems in place. We need to support progressive and heavy taxation on billionaires and millionaires, demand corporate accountability both economically and environmentally, and the reinvestment of wealth into communities that have been systematically impoverished.
    
3. **Public Ownership of Essential Services**: Healthcare, housing, education, and transportation should not be controlled by private entities that prioritize profit over people. These services must be publicly owned and universally accessible.

### **Abolition of Oppressive Systems**

4. **End to Mass Incarceration**: The prison-industrial complex disproportionately targets marginalized communities. We need to demand an end to cash bail, private prisons, and the criminalization of poverty, and divert funds into looking into actual rehabilitation centers for criminals. We should demand the Freedom of the  353,000 nonviolent drug offenders that are currently incarcerated and expunge their records.
    
5. **Demilitarization of Law Enforcement**: Police forces should not function as occupying armies nor should they have equipment that goes outside the necessary scope of their day to day job activities. We should call for the demilitarization of law enforcement, an end to qualified immunity, and the redirection of funding toward community-focused training for officers. We have seen this work in cities like Austin that cut police budgets by $150M and reinvested in mental health responders, reducing violence by 40%.
    
6. **Abolition of Corporate Influence in Politics**: Our democracy has been hijacked by corporate interests and lobbyists who seek out their own personal interests over the common man. We need to demand campaign finance records to be transparent to voters, and call for an end to corporate lobbying, and implement systems and protections against political corruption.
    

### **Housing, Healthcare, and Education as Human Rights**

1. **Guaranteed Housing for All**: Housing is a human right. We need to support rent control, tenant protections, and large-scale investment in public and cooperative housing.
    
2. **Universal Healthcare**: No one should go without medical care due to inability to pay or because the company simply doesn't want to pay for the procedure or care. We should demand a universal, single-payer healthcare system that covers all people, including mental health and reproductive care.
    
3. **Free and Equitable Education**: Higher Education must be accessible to all, not a privilege for the wealthy. We should advocate for tuition-free higher education, the abolition of student debt, and the decolonization of curricula.
    

### **Environmental Justice and Sustainability**

4. **Combat Climate Change**: Climate change is a crisis created by unchecked monopolies and corporate greed. We need to support a just transition to renewable clean energy, the protection of Indigenous land and sovereignty, and policies that hold polluters accountable.
    
5. **Food Sovereignty**: Communities should have control over their own food production. We should demand support for local agriculture, an end to food deserts, and protections against corporate monopolization of food systems.
    
6. **Public Transportation and Green Infrastructure**: A sustainable future requires investment in clean energy, affordable public transportation, and infrastructure that serves people over profit.

7. In "Cancer Alley", Louisiana for example, Black communities face 80-95% higher cancer risks than the the average national rate from oil refineries. We need to demand a ban on toxic industries in marginalized areas. 

### **International Solidarity and Anti-Imperialism**

8. **End to U.S. Imperialism**: The exploitation of other nations for economic and political gain must end. We need to demand the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from occupations and an end to economic sanctions that harm vulnerable populations.
    
9. **Support for Global Liberation Movements**: We stand in solidarity with movements worldwide fighting against colonialism, apartheid, and economic exploitation. Our struggle is interconnected with the struggles of oppressed peoples everywhere.

Our demands are not negotiable. We should not wait for permission to claim what is rightfully ours.

# Cultural Revival and Identity

Our movement is centered on the idea that liberation is deeply tied to the reclamation of our identities, histories, and cultures. The systems that oppress us have long sought to erase our voices, distort our histories, and undermine our sense of self. Our struggle is not just to tear down these systems but to rise up and reclaim what has been taken from us.

#### Reclaiming Identity Across Communities

We must demand the right to reclaim and define our identities. This is not just about restoring Black history and culture, but about ensuring that all marginalized communities—whether Indigenous, LGBTQ+, or others—can freely assert and celebrate their heritage without fear of erasure. The legacy of colonization, racism, and oppression has tried to strip us of our self-determination, but we must push back. Reclaiming our cultural identities is not just a statement of pride; it is a declaration of resistance against the forces that seek to silence us. We must do things like support Indigenous language revitalization, like Hawaii’s ʻŌlelo schools preserving ʻŌiwi culture

#### Inclusive Education and Media

Education and media must become tools of liberation rather than instruments of subjugation. Our schools should teach the full truth of history, one that reflects the experiences and struggles of marginalized groups, not just the sanitized version that serves the powerful, for example we can replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day in all 50 states and mandate Black history curricula like Florida’s pre-2022 African American Studies course. Media representation must accurately depict the diverse experiences of all people, particularly those from oppressed communities. When the media and educational systems reflect our realities, we begin to see the true potential of solidarity and unity, as people are exposed to the breadth of our shared struggles.

# Strategy and Organization

The success of any movement lies in its ability to organize, strategize, and unite people for a common cause. Our efforts must focus on empowering communities, fostering unity across struggles, and creating infrastructures that serve the needs of the people. This is not a fight that can be won by individuals, but by the collective power of communities working in solidarity.

#### Grassroots Organizing

The heart of our movement is grassroots organizing. We must build local chapters in every community where oppression thrives. These chapters will focus on the immediate needs of the people—mutual aid, education, self-defense, and community empowerment. The goal is to create autonomous spaces where communities can come together, organize, and take control of their own destinies. By organizing at the local level, we are able to build strong, decentralized networks of resistance that are not dependent on the whims of the powerful.

#### Youth Leadership and Education

The next generation is critical to our movement's success. We must prioritize the development of youth leadership, ensuring that young people are equipped with the knowledge, tools, and determination to continue the fight for justice. Through mentorship and education, we will teach young people the importance of unity and collective action, making sure they understand that their liberation is intertwined with the liberation of others. The youth are the future of this movement, and it is our duty to guide them in understanding the true nature of systemic oppression and the need for revolutionary change.

#### Community-based Solutions

It is not enough to simply resist; we must also build alternatives that empower our communities. Community-driven initiatives like healthcare clinics, educational programs, food justice projects, and housing cooperatives should be central to our strategy. These initiatives allow us to take control of our own resources, offering solutions to the issues that directly affect our communities. By investing in these projects, we begin to create systems of support that are free from the control of the state or corporations, laying the groundwork for a future where self-determination and autonomy are the norm.

# Conclusion: A Unified Vision for the Future

The fight for liberation is not just about securing freedom for one group; it is about ensuring that every oppressed person is free from the chains that bind us all. We must understand that the struggle for justice is a collective one—when one of us is free, we are all free. Our future depends on our ability to stand together in solidarity and fight for a world built on equity and justice.
True liberation cannot be achieved unless it is collective. The struggles of Black, Indigenous, and other marginalized communities are deeply connected. When one group rises, we all rise. The forces of oppression that work to divide us—whether through racism, classism, imperialism, or any other system of exploitation—thrive on our division. But when we stand united, we can dismantle the systems that seek to oppress us all. Our liberation is bound together, and it is through solidarity that we will create a world where justice, dignity, and freedom are not privileges but the birthright of every person.

## Call to Action

It is not just within our capacity to rebel but our obligation to. We are brought into this world on a speeding train towards a brick wall and are granted but only one prolonged moment to do what we desire. With this knowledge we should strive to affirm and enrich our independent lives in unity, in our refusal to accept the status quo, and in our determination to fight for a better world. When we accept any form of oppression we are not above our opponent, but rather the opposite. This is not a struggle that will be won through passivity or submission—it is a struggle that demands action, solidarity, and unwavering commitment. Together, we can create a future where freedom, justice, and equality are the rights of all people.

# Author's Postscript
---
In all honesty I wrote this in deep thought of the issues our country and parts of the world face and in response to comments I saw from others talking about the need of a new Black Panther Party. I doubt anyone on the entire planet will ever read this and doubt more that anyone will even take this seriously ( but if u happen to be that 1% share this :) thanks ). This should serve as a starting point for any grassroots movement in America or any country. The issue with groups like Antifa for example is that they demonized entire margins of groups leaving them feeling alienated and withdrawn, its key that this be avoided at all cost in ANY movement. And with Antifa being labeled as a Domestic Terrorist Group its important that whatever group comes next is able to operate like that of a surgeons scalpel, and surgically and precisely tackle the issues they want to at hand. Anyway I'll get my ass back to living my life and shit.

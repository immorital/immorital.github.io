I had an interaction with someone I followed online that led me to actually question something I think is key and important to our current society and to radicalization.<br/><br/>

They made a post about Hulk Hogan, arguing that we should forgive him for the things he has said. At first, I was quick to dismiss it as just another case of a Black man bending under the pressures and narratives of our white-dominated society. That is to say: I thought this nigga was Uncle Ruckus.<br/><br/>

Yet, when I confronted them on the topic and we had a discussion, I realized they had tapped into something I hadnâ€™t yet, and I ended up confronting myself instead. As Christians, we are called by God to forgive. But as a Christian Socialist, I wondered: how is this really done in a world as unjust as ours? We all understand right and wrong, and yes, forgiveness is essential, but how do we extend it to those who wish harm upon others because of their race or sexuality? How do we forgive those who justify genocide in the name of ethnicity? Or those complicit in allowing children to starve to death? I pondered this question for some time because it is not an easy one to solve.<br/><br/>

It seems that true forgiveness cannot exist in isolation from accountability, solidarity, or struggle. The most dangerous form of forgiveness is that which ignores harm, seeks personal peace at the expense of justice, and eventually evolves into complicity. Forgiveness, therefore, has to be practiced with awareness. It must refuse to let hatred consume us while also not allowing any excuses or letting people ignore evil.<br/><br/>

In the modern age, these questions seem to rear their ugly heads constantly. Whether it is forgiving a racist coworker, a corrupt politician (in this case, all of them), or an exploitive corporation (again, all of them), it is not about ignoring their actions or giving them leeway, but about preserving our humanity and refusing to let bitterness dictate our lives. For too long, I feel Christians have turned the other cheek without demanding justice. We turn, get slapped again, and repeat the cycle. It is one reason our religion has been twisted and co-opted by the MAGA-fueled fascist regime. Forgiveness should not operate this way; it should be a deliberate act, matched with accountability and reinforced by action. We forgive so that our hearts remain capable of love and solidarity, but do not be fooled: this does not mean abandoning our posts, nor does it mean we should stop organizing, protesting, or demanding justice. Forgiveness should strengthen it.<br/><br/>

For Christian Socialists, it is especially important to remember that forgiveness is not an abdication of responsibility but a tool for sustaining the struggle. It is a path that ensures our fight for justice is fueled by clarity and compassion rather than resentment. (Though I will say, The United Daughters of the Confederacy are exempt from this entire document. If you do not know about them, look them up.) It is in the fiery pits of mercy and resistance, compassion and accountability, that our faith and politics meet.<br/><br/>

We live in a world where oppression is no longer always visible. It is systemic, hidden between the lines. A world where cruelty is masked as ordinary life, speaking truth, or just asking questions. To forgive these heretics without surrender, to love without weakening our resolve, is perhaps one of the most radical acts of faith we can practice. In doing so, we are reminded that our call is not only about personal holiness (and if yours is, you might want to check yourself), but about collective liberation. Liberation that leads to a world where justice is not deferred and mercy does not come at the expense of truth.

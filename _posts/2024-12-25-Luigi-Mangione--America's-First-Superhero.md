After conversations with others, fighting with those who before I'd say id politically align, self reflection and I signing up and renewing my health insurance I think its finally time that I sit down and discuss recent events It is without reserve or hesitation that I applaud the assassination of Brian Thompson by Luigi Mangione.  
  
This act of retribution has been boiling in the social zeitgeist for a while, and has been carried out on behalf of the American people. Those in power have tried and have continued to try to refute and ignore this reality, but their attempts are only fueled by their own stupidity, greed, and social ignorance.  
  
It doesn't take a rocket scientist, or a lawyer, or economist to explain the hellish landscape that is the American healthcare system. Within his own manifesto, Luigi points out the hypocrisy and irony in the fact that despite having the most expensive healthcare and access to the best and newest medications, we only rank #42 in terms of life expectancy. In this country medical emergencies carry only 2 outcomes : Death and Financial Ruin. And as a country that runs culturally and functionally on capital financial ruin is true ruin, it is a fate where to many death would be the preferable outcome, and in some cases is.  
  
The assassination grew out of hatred for the American medical system. But it is not limited to just the healthcare industry and one would be foolish to assume so. The wealthy class in America has manipulated the minority and taken control of our lives as if we were pawns on a chess board. We live in a plutocracy, a society controlled by the ultra-rich, with a sheet of democracy placed over our eyes. As Mangione stated, this is a disease which does require treatment and we have let the wealthy for too long deny us of our free agency. When Mangione shot at Thompson, he too shot at that plutocratic apparatus which monopolizes and profits of our daily lives.  
  
  
Many people, even those who I looked up too politically, who lauded themselves as being more mature, intelligent, or possessing some divine calmness and proclaim from their high-horse that Mangione's actions are something that we should beware of and how we should not use violence to enact change, have nothing but foolish perspectives.  
  
Have you forgotten so easily your forefathers, who fought for your rights from British rule? Have you forgotten so easily the northern soldiers who fought to free your ancestors from their chains? Have you forgotten so easily the women who imprisoned themselves for your ability to vote?  
  
Out-of-touch Liberals like governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania insist that bloodshed is not how we solve problems in America. I wonder if shapiro is aware of the world outside of his mansion. Does he think that the Iraqi's who lost their sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters, when the American military invaded and killed them? Perhaps he should return to his studies, maybe he should return from a life where he has clearly forgotten the American War of Independence.  
  
But do not be like Shapiro. Do not be ignorant. Do not willingly forget. Americans have long protested our healthcare system, and for a long time nothing has been done. We have produced all sorts of media to voice our opinions, and they've led us nowhere. Foolish people, Like Shapiro, will say that our voices need to be heard at ballot boxes. But let me remind you that for millennia the American public has voted for candidates that, time after time, have promised us reform. And yet never have any delivered on their promise. This isn't a thing that ONLY the left does. This isn't a thing that ONLY the right does. This is a thing that ONLY the WEALTHY do.  
  
I ask Shapiro and his companions : How long should we continue to walk down this road of failure? How long should we continue to live like dogs eating scraps and being driven to eat each other? How many Americans must die by the hands of the very industry meant to sustain our lives?  
  
Mangione killed One man, this year. The Healthcare Industry leaves 26,000 Americans to the slaughter each year because they lack proper coverage, or cannot pay the demands.  
  
People consistently point out the fact that Brian had a family who are now having to endure significant trauma. But I ask so too did the slave masters who died under Nat Turner. Does that make the abolitionist movement invalid? They also say that this will not change the American Healthcare system. And in part this is true, but it is nothing more than a strawman. Nobody believes or should believe that this will change our healthcare system, I believe even Mangione was aware of this. But what it does is ring alarms for this in power, in such a way that they can no longer ignore. This will inspire the younger generation, those rising into power. ho will replace those currently in power, and inspire them to enact real change. These actions aren't solutions, nor are they endings. They are beginnings.  
  
For years we have been divided. Left Vs Right. Red vs Blue. And this event, this disdain for our healthcare system has reunited us. And because of that, it's only a matter of time before they start tearing into Magiones character, they will cherry pick his opinions on various stupid and meaningless culture war issues to imprint hatred on Mangione in the public consciousness. Be wary of this act as its nothing more than dishonesty and and act of irrelevance.  
  
Magione is clearly and evidently an intelligent young man with opinions that function independently of one another and this is good, because he cannot be simplified or dumbed down to being described as as left or right or center, because that's unnecessary categorization. Mangione is not an insane ma. He isn't someone suffering from a psychotic breaki but rather someone suffering from the same oppression that millions of americans experience. When a person is attacxked, its only natural for them to attack back, this retaliation is not a sign of insanity or shock abberration but an expected result.  
  
  
Those in power will seek to falsely blame and delcare Mangione as insane. This is incorrect, and shouldnt be taken seriously. For these people, blame, instead can be found in the mirror. Despite what it might seem, I do not want violence, on the contrary I want peace. But I also want the cessation of greed and brutality of the healthcare system. I want logic, intelligence, and compassion. If we want the current trend of events to continue then we don't need to merely want violence, it will just naturally occur.

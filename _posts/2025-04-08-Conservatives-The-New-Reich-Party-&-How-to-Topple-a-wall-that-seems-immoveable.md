The day after Donald Trump's inauguration feels heavy with the weight of irony and tragedy to weigh it down. For little over two centuries, America presented itself as a beacon of democracy and a sworn enemy of tyranny, oppression, and restriction of freedom, yet yesterday marks the first time in history where the coronation was held for a president who's rise is entwined with the very forces and ideologies we once claimed to resist. His ascension is not just a sign of political failure, or the rampant and ever increasing spread of misinformation, its a moral collapse, once that is rendered itself in the ideals of liberty, equality, and justice are nothing more than mere shiny toys to be paraded in speeches while being abandoned in practice and legislation.  

The imagery of last night's events demands our attention. Not because of their grandeur but due the grotesque symbolism which was displayed. The scene at Capital Arena is nothing short of a masterstroke of manufactured reverence, in simpler terms, its a carefully orchestrated spectacle designed to evoke awe from MAGA supporters and vulnerable citizens while disguising the corrosion of the countries elected leaders beneath the surface. Yet amid the ceremonial fanfare, one moment shattered the illusion and laid bare the true character of this new era that we are rushing in.  

Elon Musk, a man whose fortune and influence have allowed him for the past 6 years to fashion himself as a modern-day Prometheus, took to the stage to congratulate his close friend and ally, Donald Trump. What unfolded next was as shocking as it was revealing : Musk raised his arm in a salute, a gesture that can only be described as a Nazi Salute.

Let us not mince words.  
This was no accident.
This was no misstep.
This was no misunderstood gesture.  

It was a deliberate act, performed in full view of the world, embodying the dark reality we currently now face. This act evokes a flurry of emotion - Anger, despair, sadness, hatred, and if you feel this know that you are justified in them. In these moments we must resist the temptation to be paralyzed by these feelings. We must harness them, Turn our collective outrage into a force capable of challenging the plutocratic system that brought us here.  


## The Rise of the Plutocratic State  
As much as I'd like to say I was blindsided by last nights actions, the sad reality is, I'm not. To understand the significance of Musk's gesture, we must first confront the broader context in which it occurred, as the media and right-wing media specifically will try to change this context. America has always wrestled with the tension between Democracy and Capitalism, but in recent decades and years, that tension has tipped in the favor of the latter., What we now face is not just a crisis of governance but a wholesale capture of the state by which the ultra-rich are the ones who select the ruling class and which laws will effect the everyday citizen. This new plutocracy isn't content with economic domination alone; Its very clear and evident that they seek to reshape the cultural and political landscape to cement its power indefinitely. Figures like Musk and Trump are not anomalies, they merely are logical outcomes of a system that, despite its upsides, rewards greed, punishes dissent, and equates wealth with virtue. They represent and embody a new ruling class, one that seeks to see itself unbound by the constraints of morality and accountability.  

This Nazi salute then, is not a gesture.  
This is a declaration of intent.  

It signals a willingness to abandon even the pretense of democratic values in favor of a regime that prioritizes power and profit above all else.  
It is a warning of what is to come if we do not act.  

## The Wall That Must Be Toppled  
The challenge before us today, feels insurmountable, like standing in front of an immovable wall. This wall however, Is not made of brick and mortar but of systemic oppression, economic inequality, and apathy displayed by those who benefit from the status quo. It is fortified by propaganda, by the normalization of injustice, and by the fear that paralyzes those who would resist.  
I no longer will be paralyzed  
History reminds us that no wall is truly immovable. The Berlin Wall, apartheid, colonial empires - all once seemed invincible until they crumbled under the weight of collective resistance. The question is not whether this wall can fall but rather whether we have the courage, the strategy, and the unity to make it happen.  

## A Call to Arms  
Our resistance cannot be a mere reaction; It must be a deliberate, sustained effort. We can no longer afford to rely on polite appeals to those in power or to place our hopes and dreams in the hands of our elected officials and institutions that have failed us time and time again.  

The time for incremental reform has long since passed.  
What is needed now is a radical reimagining of our society, one that centers justice, equity, and human dignity.  

Reject the narratives that normalize our oppression. The salute Musk performed is not an isolated incident. We all saw and gave witness as those who threatened our very democratic process were given the green light to be free, to live without consequence. This is signs of a broader effort to desensitize us to authoritarianism, to make us believe that resistance is futile.  

We **MUST** reject this lie.  

As Luigi Mangione pointed out, we must come to recognize the power of solidarity. The ruling class thrives on our division - pitting workers against one another , distracting us with cultural battles while they hoard wealth and power right in front of us. Our greatest weapon, besides the arms our forefathers once told us to carry, is our unity, our ability to see through these tactics and organize not just across economic lines, but lines of race and geography.  

Let me be clear, The cost of inaction is not hypothetical. Everyday, thousands of Americans, suffer and die because of a healthcare system that prioritizes profit over lives, social media that pushes unrealistic standards and pornography, they die because the wages that do not provide dignity, because of a climate crisis that has gone ignored for decades in-favor of short term gains on the S&P Index.  

The salute we witnessed last night is a symptom of a larger disease, a visible reminder of the violence that underpins our society that is bred and funded by the rich elites. If we do nothing, this violence will only escalate, History teaches us that authoritarianism doesn't stop or start at symbolic gestures. It grows, it consumes, it destroys. The longer we wait, the harder it will be to reverse. What we witnessed last night was not an ending but a beginning . 

It was a call to arms - not merely for anger, but for courage, for imagination, and for the unrelenting pursuit of justice. Resistance takes many forms, and history has shown us that change often demands sacrifice, confrontation, and an unwavering commitment against tyranny in all its manifestations, to fight and bring down all threats, foreign and domestic.  

The wall that is before us may seem immovable but it is not. Together, we have the power to tear it down. Whether through peaceful defiance or meeting force with force when necessary, we must commit ourselves to dismantling the systems that uphold oppression and injustice.  

Let this moment be the one where we decide to act, not from a place of fear, but from a deep and abiding love for what our country was and could become.  
Remember : The future is not yet written. The wall will fall - but only if we make it so.
